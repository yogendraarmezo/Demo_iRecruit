            <p>We do not use the Services to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of eighteen (18).

            <p><strong>Data Security, Integrity and Retention</strong></p>
            <p>Your privacy is very important to iRecruit and we are committed to protecting your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. We have implemented physical, technical and administrative security measures for the Services that comply with applicable laws and industry standards. For example, we use firewalls, encryption technology and other automated software designed to protect against fraud and identity theft.</p>
            <p>When a Customer downloads and uses an App or website that requests iRecruit to provide the Services, we may collect and process information locally on the Customer’s mobile or desktop device. This allows us to identify the sensitivity level of certain device information prior to transferring it to our servers for storage. Rather than sending sensitive device information as raw data that can be easily associated with the relevant Customer, we only transfer representations of certain types of information back to iRecruit. Our servers then associate the representations with a unique identifier assigned to each Customer by iRecruit. When a Customer subsequently interacts with the Services, this process allows us to provide the Services without storing the sensitive information in a form that would be easily readable to unauthorized third parties.</p>
            <p>iRecruit also protects Customer’s privacy by seeking to minimize the amount of sensitive data that we store on our servers in the first place. You may also contact us anytime with your questions or concerns.</p>
            <p>iRecruit retains the raw data it collects from Customers for as long as needed to provide the Services. The information received from Business Partners is retained for as long as needed to provide you Services. We will retain and use the information we receive for as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
            <p>You acknowledge that all information, data, text, software, documents, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages, tags, or other materials (“Content”​ ), whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, are the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Content originated, and that You, and not iRecruit, is entirely responsible for all Content that you upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available via the Services. You understand that by using the Services, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable. Under no circumstances will iRecruit or its parent, holding, subsidiary or related companies, affiliates, officers, agents or employees, as the case may be, be liable in any way for any Content or any loss or damage, no matter the cause of the loss or damage, of any kind incurred as a result of the use of the Services.</p>
